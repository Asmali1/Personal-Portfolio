// Connect 4 game that is played through a user interface created in MATLAB. The interface allows the player to select a column to drop their game piece into by pressing a key on the keyboard, ranging from 1 to 7. The game continues until one player gets four of their game pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full and the game ends in a draw. The interface updates in real-time to reflect the current state of the game and displays messages to the player indicating whose turn it is, whether the move was successful, and if the game has been won or ended in a draw.

The site offers dual-language support with translations in Arabic and English across the platform. An integrated Athan API auto-detects user locations, providing real-time prayer times, which users can navigate through with next and previous buttons. Additionally, a dynamic countdown adjusts based on the user's current time, automatically updating to reflect the closest upcoming prayer time."
